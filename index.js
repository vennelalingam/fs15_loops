/*------------------
1)
In the loop below, fix the
statement inside the body of the
do loop so that the console 
prints the numbers from 0-10.
------------------*/



/*------------------
2)
Create a loop that counts
up to 100.
------------------*/



/*------------------
3)
Create a loop that counts
down from 100.
------------------*/

/*------------------
4)
Add a console.log statement
in the body of the loop below
so that it prints the numbers
from zero to four.
------------------*/


 
/*------------------
5)
Add a JavaScript expression
inside the ${} so that it prints
the difference between the capacity
and the count of people.
------------------*/


/*------------------
6)
Add all EVEN numbers between 0 and 50.
Print output in console.log at the end.

Hint: increase your count by two each
time you iterate!
------------------*/


/*------------------
7)
Now, create a for loop that prints
ALL numbers between 0 and 50
to the console.

Add an if/else statement within the
body of the loop. If the number (x) is 
even, print `The number ${x} is even`.
If the number (x) is odd, print
`The number ${x} is odd`.
------------------*/

/*------------------
8)
Let's try something new. 

To select a character in a string,
use "charAt()", and insert the number
you want to access inside the parentheses.
For example: "Sofia".charAt(0) is "S"
and "Sofia".charAt(2) is "f"

Using ".toUpperCase" converts a letter to
uppercase.

Make ONE change in the code below so
that every other letter is uppercase.
------------------*/



/*------------------
9)
Write a program that uses console.log to
print all the numbers from 1 to 100.

Now, for all numbers divisible by 3,
print "Fizz" instead of the number.
For numbers divisible by 5,
print "Buzz" instead.
For numbers divisible by BOTH 5 & 3, 
print "FizzBuzz".

This is a very common interview question.
Good luck!

/*------------------
10)
Create the triangle below by writing
a loop that makes five calls to console.log.

let trianle = "*"
//
//let triangle = "*"
//for
