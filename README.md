# Loops

In this repository, you will practice writing and using loops.

## Objectives

- Use counters, conditions, and iterators in loops.
- Create a do while loop, while loop, and for loop.

## Basic Requirements

Complete all of the questions in the `index.js` file.

### 1. Open the file in your browser

- Open the `index.html` file.
  - Note where this file connects to the JavaScript file.
  - Open the file in your browser.
  - Open the JavaScript console to see the results of your code.

### 2. Answer all of the challenges

- Answer each question in the challenges file.
- When you are done answering, comment it out!
  - To comment out a line, use `//` in front of the line, or encapsulate the entire line with `*/ code /*`.

### Commit early, commit often

- After each major change, make a commit to Github. Here's a [cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet) for commands and tips for writing good commit messages.
  - `git status` checks for changes (optional)
  - `git add .` adds all files 
  - `git commit -m"MESSAGE"` adds commit message
  - `git push` pushes changes
